# ENGINEERING STUDENTS PLACEMENT ANALYSIS - 2013 & 2014

# Dataset Explanation: 

This dataset provides information about college students and various factors that might influence their placement status. It includes demographic details, academic performance, internship experience, and other relevant aspects that help in understanding what contributes to a student's success in getting placed.

## **Key Features Explained:**

### 1. **Age:**  
- Represents the age of the students in years.  
- It could be explored to see if age has any impact on placement outcomes.  

### 2. **Gender:**  
- Indicates the gender of the students, categorized as "Male" or "Female."  
- Useful for analyzing if there is any gender-based disparity in placements.

### 3. **Stream:**  
- Refers to the academic discipline or branch of study, such as "Computer Science," "Mechanical," or "Information Technology."  
- Certain streams may have higher placement rates depending on industry demand.

### 4. **Internships:**  
- Shows the number of internships completed by the student.  
- Internships often provide practical experience, which may improve placement chances.

### 5. **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average):**  
- Reflects the student's overall academic performance on a scale (typically 0 to 10).  
- Higher CGPA often correlates with better placement opportunities.

### 6. **Hostel:**  
- A binary feature indicating whether the student lives in a hostel (1) or not (0).  
- It could be examined to see if living in a hostel offers better networking or learning opportunities.

### 7. **HistoryOfBacklogs:**  
- Indicates whether the student has had any backlogs (academic failures) during their course of study.  
- Backlogs might negatively impact placement opportunities.

### 8. **PlacedOrNot:**  
- The target variable indicating whether the student was placed (1) or not (0).  
- This is the outcome we aim to understand and predict using the other features.

## **Potential Analysis:**
- **Correlation Analysis:**  
  - To identify which factors (CGPA, internships, backlogs) significantly impact placements.
  
- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  - Building machine learning models to predict whether a student will get placed based on their profile.

- **Stream-wise Placement Rate:**  
  - To observe which academic streams have higher placement success rates.

- **Internship Impact:**  
  - To examine if students with internships have better placement outcomes compared to those without.
